# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage and dynamic table of UFO sighting data. The featured table needed to have filtering capability with JavaScript. The user should be able to filter the UFO sighting data by: date, city, state, country, shape.


## Results
The filters to the left of the data table allow the user to filter by: date, city, state, country, shape (of the object observed). The user can filter their search by entering text in one/multiple/all of the input boxes.

To filter the table, fill in the input box of your desired filter in the same format as the placeholder text. For example, if you wanted to filter by date, match your desired date to the format provided: 1/10/2010. To filter for sightings on 1/1/2010 in El Cajon, California, your filter inputs would look like this:

To clear all filters, you can delete the text from each input box, or you can navigate to the top left of the page and click: "UFO Sightings".

## Summary
One drawback of this design is not having a button, located beneath the filters, to clear the current filter(s). In the current webpage, you have to go to the top left and click the header "UFO Sightings" to clear the filters. 
To further develop this webpage, I would add a "Clear Filters" button underneath the filter options on the left side of the table. Additionally, I would add another filter for "Duration". This filter would follow the format of the other filters, where the user can input a duration that matches the format of the placeholder text.
